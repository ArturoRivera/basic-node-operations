1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how
they work and what the output was.

Answer:
- Sort printed every line of code from the commands.js file. Each hierarchy
in the code was grouped together and alphabetically sorted by the first word of
the line.

- WC printed out the # of lines, the number of words and the number of characters.

- Uniq sorted each line in the file and only returned different lines and
removed the duplicate lines next to each other.

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js.
Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

Answer:
sort commands.js | uniq: This sorted everything in commands.js then removed any
duplicate lines that were next to each other. For instance, it
removed duplicate break;

When things are piped the first command executes and then the second will take
the info that was executed and execute the second command.

6. Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence
while maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string.
To improve your problem-solving experience, use the suggested functions to solve
the problem.

Answer:
function reverseString(inputString) {
      return inputString.split('').reverse().join('');
    };
